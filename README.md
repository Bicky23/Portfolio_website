# Data Science Projects

Some of my projects with descriptions:

## [Face Mask & Helmet Detection using YOLOv3](https://github.com/Bicky23/Helmet_Mask_Detection/)
* This project was built with the motivation of improving the safety standards of construction workers who are working tirelessly during the COVID-19 crisis.
* Main objective is to detect presence of **face mask** and **helmet** if the image contains a face.
* **YOLOv3** was the object detection algorithm used mainly due to its fast response time.

## [Spell Checker using FastText](https://github.com/Bicky23/FastText-Spell-Checker)
* Although trivial, spell checking is highly **context-dependent**
* This project uses **character embeddings** to address the issue. 
* **Character embeddings** over **word embeddings** to negate the effect of **out-of-bag** words.


## [Company Classification using RoBERTa](https://github.com/Bicky23/Company-Classification-using-RoBERTa)
* Multi-class classification of company into *62* categories using `Business Description` attribute.
* **RoBERTa**, a Transformers based architecture was used to perform it with `multiclass F-1` and `ROC_AUC` scores as metrics.
